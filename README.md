## Description

My unit 2 project is an App that lets registered users add tracks to a song library and then create playlists using those tracks. I have a passion for music and DJing so I felt like it would be a fun a idea.

## How to Use

Upon arrival at the home screen guests are asked to sign in so they can access the site.
<br> Once logged in users are able to
<br>- Add, edit and delete tracks to the song library
<br>- Create, edit and delete playlists
<br>- Add any tracks from the song libary into any of their playlists

## Next steps

- Allow users to view the other users playlists
- Maybe add an up/downvote system

- Intergrate YouTube API so users can actually search YouTube and if they get a hit on a song it would also link the video to play the songs in the playlists.
